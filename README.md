# Library Management UI ðŸ“š

This project is an interactive single-page application built with React that simulates a library management interface. It allows users to view a list of books and perform actions like searching, adding, and removing books from the list dynamically, demonstrating key concepts of state management and event handling in React.

# ðŸŒŸ Features
Dynamic Rendering: The UI updates in real-time based on state changes.

Search Functionality: Users can filter the book list by a book's title or author.

Add Books: A simple form allows users to add new books to the list.

Remove Books: Each book entry has a "Remove" button to delete it from the list.

State Management: The application's state (books, search query, etc.) is managed within a single component.
